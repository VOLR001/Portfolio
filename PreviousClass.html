<h1> American Lit II [English245] with Donna Cowan </h1> 
<hr>
<p> 
I thoroughly enjoyed my english class with Mrs. Cowan. I had experience with english classes before and reading heavily, however I was not prepared for looking analytically at the format the author chose to display their story. I learned several techniques through the course to get a more thorough understanding of what the author meant to say to the reader.
